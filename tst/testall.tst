# To run a single test, call

#     Read("../gapcode.g");
#     Test("testall.tst");
#
# in GAP (correct path to the file, if necessary)
#
# However, you can more conveniently test all `.tst` files in this directory by 
# reading `tst/testall.g` file into GAP (from the root directory of this repository).

# First, a single example

gap> double(-1);

# You can also test error messages, for example
#gap> double("a");
#Error, The argument must be an integer

#This is a code for calculating the average order of an element in a finite group

#This gap code gives the cyclic presentation P_n(w). It takes as inputs that number of generators n and a
#list L consisting of integers z between 1 and n which tracks the subscript and index of the corresponding generator in w
